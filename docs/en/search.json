    "text": "Introduction\nThe Cycling in Montpellier website offers an in-depth exploration of cycling traffic in the city, combining interactive visualizations and dynamic data analysis. It allows for the examination of circulation trends, identification of peak traffic periods, and an understanding of cyclistsâ€™ behaviors over time. With interactive tools such as videos, maps, and graphs, this platform provides a detailed and insightful view of the evolution of cycling traffic in Montpellier, making it a valuable resource for better understanding bicycle use in the city.\n\n\nDensity over a Day\nThe video below allows real-time visualization of data related to bicycle journeys within the city for a specific day (2024-10-07). It provides a dynamic representation of cyclistsâ€™ movements, with routes traced on the map, enabling the tracking of journey intensity. Based on the density of these journeys in specific areas, points are displayed on the map: they appear small when there are few passages and increase in size proportionally as the density of cyclists grows. This visualization system helps to better understand traffic flows and identify high-activity areas, facilitating the analysis of bike journey distribution in the city during this particular day. This approach enables quick recognition of trends and highlights areas to monitor, providing a clear and intuitive perspective on bicycle use in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraffic Prediction\nDiscover our interactive map, which allows you to explore the cycling traffic forecasts in Montpellier for each day of the week. Using historical data, this map highlights areas with high cyclist traffic. It provides an overview of traffic trends, helping to identify the most frequented areas. With this visualization, you can anticipate the zones that are likely to be the busiest. This feature enables more informed planning and helps optimize cycling movement within the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
